We are pleased to announce the 2025 OpenMS Open House.<br>
**Location: Myhal Centre for Engineering Innovation and Entrepreneurship (MY), Room 430, University of Toronto** <br>
**Date: November 9th, 2025 From 10am-2pm** <br>
**Format: Drop-in session — come by anytime, stay as long or as little as you’d like**! <br>

This event offers a great opportunity to:
- Discuss **computational mass spectrometry** and its application
- Learn more about **open-source software development**
- Explore posters on selected topics including pyOpenMS, pyOpenMS_viz, OpenMS WebApps, Library Free DIA with OpenSWATH and DIAWeaver
- **Bring your own data** for discussion and feedback
- **Discuss your research**, your use of OpenMS, or your own open-source tool
- **Potential collaborations** — or bring along that tricky problem your current software just throws its hands up at


The meeting is planned such that one can attend the Open House and [HUPO](https://2025.hupo.org) the following week. Note that HUPO requires separate registration.
