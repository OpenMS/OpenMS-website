# OpenMS Invites the Computational Mass Spectrometry Community to Join Google Summer of Code 2025! 

**We are excited to announce** that OpenMS is applying to participate as an umbrella organization in this year’s [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)! This provides a fantastic opportunity to contribute to the growth and innovation in the field of computational mass spectrometry by mentoring talented students from around the world.

As an umbrella organization, we would like to extend an invitation to other projects and groups within the computational mass spectrometry and proteomics/metabolomics communities to join us in this effort. If your project aligns with the goals of GSoC and you are interested in mentoring a student project, we encourage you to submit your proposals by **February 11th at 18:00 UTC.**

> **Note:** This webpage will be continuously updated to reflect new project proposals. Please check in regularly.

## Mentors

**GSoC is program** that connects open-source projects with enthusiastic contributors, fostering collaboration and the development of innovative solutions. By mentoring a GSoC project, you’ll have the opportunity to:

- Guide and inspire the next generation of developers and researchers.
- Gain valuable contributions to your project from highly motivated students.
- Strengthen the open-source community within computational mass spectrometry.

### Submitting a Proposal:

- Please read the [GSoC Mentor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) to get a better idea of what it entails.  
- Mentors generally spend 3–5 hours per week mentoring their student.  
- OpenMS has an active [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/4TAGhqJ7s5). This is the best way to contact the OpenMS team and coordinate project proposals and mentorship.  
- **The deadline to submit a project proposal as a mentor is February 11th at 18:00 UTC.**

## Projects

### 1) Integrate Apache Parquet into OpenMS Build System

**Proposed Mentors:** Timo Sachsenberg  
**Skills:** CMake, GitHub CI, C++, Python  
**Estimated Project Length:** 350 hours | **Difficulty:** Medium  

Proteomics and metabolomics mass spectrometry studies are generating datasets of unprecedented size as they scale to include more and more samples. Managing and processing these large datasets efficiently requires robust and scalable data handling solutions to make results readily available for downstream processing tasks like machine learning.

The task is to integrate Apache Parquet, a columnar storage format, into OpenMS as a fundamental step toward enabling faster data processing, reducing memory usage, and improving scalability. The integration will involve:
1. Updating the OpenMS build system with new CMake configurations.  
2. Developing comprehensive tests to validate functionality and performance.  
3. Adapting CI/CD pipelines for macOS, Linux, and Windows to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

**Let’s make GSoC 2025 a memorable and productive experience for everyone involved!**

Best regards,  
The OpenMS-Developers
