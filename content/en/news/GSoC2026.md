# Available Projects 

## Theme A) Data Formats and Interoperability

### 1) imzML Parser in OpenMS

**Proposed Mentors:** OpenMS Team  
**Skills:** C++, XML Parsing, Mass Spectrometry Imaging  
**Estimated Project Length:** 350 hours | **Difficulty:** Medium

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful analytical technique that enables spatial mapping of molecules in biological tissues. The imzML format is the open standard for storing MSI data, consisting of two files: an XML metadata file and a binary data file. While imzML is widely used in the MSI community, OpenMS currently lacks native support for reading and writing this format.

The goal of this project is to implement a robust imzML parser in OpenMS, enabling seamless integration of mass spectrometry imaging data into existing OpenMS workflows.

Tasks:

1. Implement a C++ imzML reader that can parse both continuous and processed imzML formats.
2. Implement an imzML writer to enable export of imaging data.
3. Add support for common imzML metadata (coordinates, pixel size, spectrum parameters).
4. Integrate the parser with existing OpenMS data structures (MSExperiment, MSSpectrum).
5. Write comprehensive unit tests and validate against reference imzML datasets.
6. Document the new functionality and provide usage examples.

### 2) Full Python Bindings Using Nanobind

**Proposed Mentors:** OpenMS Team  
**Skills:** Python, C++, Nanobind, Cython  
**Estimated Project Length:** 350 hours | **Difficulty:** Medium to Advanced

PyOpenMS provides Python bindings for OpenMS, enabling Python developers to access the powerful mass spectrometry algorithms implemented in OpenMS. Currently, these bindings are generated using Cython via the autowrap package. While functional, this approach has limitations in terms of maintenance overhead, compile times, and certain Python integration features.

Nanobind is a modern C++17 library for creating Python bindings with minimal overhead. An existing prototype demonstrates the feasibility of using nanobind for OpenMS Python bindings. This project aims to build upon this prototype to create comprehensive nanobind-based Python bindings for OpenMS.

A key deliverable of this project is a thorough evaluation comparing nanobind-based bindings against the current autowrap/Cython implementation. This evaluation should cover:

- **Performance:** Binding overhead, memory usage, call latency
- **Build System:** Compile times, dependency management, CI/CD integration
- **Usability:** Python API ergonomics, documentation generation, IDE support
- **Maintenance:** Code complexity, debugging experience, update workflow
- **Compatibility:** Python version support, platform compatibility, NumPy/SciPy integration

Tasks:

1. Evaluate the existing nanobind prototype and identify gaps in coverage.
2. Extend the nanobind bindings to cover core OpenMS classes and algorithms.
3. Implement automatic binding generation where feasible to reduce maintenance burden.
4. Conduct systematic benchmarking comparing nanobind vs. autowrap/Cython bindings.
5. Document advantages and disadvantages of each approach with concrete examples.
6. Write unit tests ensuring feature parity with existing PyOpenMS functionality.
7. Provide a recommendation report for future binding strategy based on findings.

### 3) Accelerating OpenSwathWorkflow for Large-Scale In Silico Spectral Libraries
**Proposed Mentors:** Joshua Charkow
**Skills:** C++, Algorithm Optimization, Profiling
**Estimated Project Length:** 200 hours | Difficulty: Medium

OpenSwathWorkflow is a central component of OpenMS for Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) analysis, enabling targeted extraction and scoring of chromatographic signals using spectral libraries. While OpenSwathWorkflow performs well for conventional experimental libraries, the increasing adoption of large in silico–generated spectral libraries presents substantial computational challenges. Such libraries can contain millions of precursors, leading to increased memory usage, longer runtimes, and scalability bottlenecks in candidate selection and scoring.

This project aims to analyze and improve the computational performance and scalability of OpenSwathWorkflow, with a particular focus on workflows using very large in silico spectral libraries. The goal is to identify bottlenecks, redesign performance-critical components where necessary, and introduce optimizations that enable efficient processing without compromising identification quality.

A key deliverable of this project is a systematic performance evaluation of OpenSwathWorkflow before and after optimization.

Tasks:
1. Develop a comprehensive understanding for the OpenSwathWorkflow algorithm
1. Develop a benchmarking dataset for profiling. 
2. Profile OpenSwathWorkflow to identify computational bottlenecks.
3. Identify algorithmic bottlenecks and propose changes. 
4. Experiment with different algorithms using inspiration from other open source DIA projects.  
5. Validate that the optimized implementation provides comparable results to the original implementation and other DIA software tools.

## Theme B) Dependency management

### Unify development dependencies using vcpkg

**Proposed Mentors**: OpenMS Team
**Skills**: CMake, Git, Command Line, Linux, macOS, Windows
**Estimated Project Length**: 240 hours | **Difficulty**: Medium

Like many large scale software projects, OpenMS has numerous
development dependencies.  Unfortunately, there is no straightforward
way to quickly and easily install all of these dependencies.  Some can
be installed using various package managers such as `apt-get`, `brew`,
or `choco`, while others need to be installed with a Python package
manager such as `conda`.  And finally, some dependencies need to be
compiled from source code manually.

The goal of this project is to unify dependency management using the
vcpkg package manager.  A successful outcome will be a simplified
developer experience where only a small number of tools are required
in order to set up a full OpenMS development environment.  For OpenMS
dependencies that are not available in vcpkg, it will be necessary to
contribute a recipe to the vcpkg community using Git.

## Theme C) Visualization and results

### Interactive Proteoform-Centric Visualization and Targeted Spectrum Analysis for Top-Down Proteomics
Proposed Mentors: Kyowon Jeong, Tom Müller
 Skills: Python, mass spectrometry, proteomics, data visualization, OpenMS, web development
 Estimated Project Length: about 350 hours | Difficulty: Advanced

Top-down proteomics enables the direct analysis of intact proteoforms, providing unparalleled insight into proteoforms, distinct molecular forms of a protein arising from a single gene, including protein isoforms, truncations, and post-translational modifications. However, interpreting individual spectra and connecting observed masses to biologically meaningful proteoforms remains a major bottleneck.
This project aims to develop an interactive, proteoform-centric visualization and manual analysis tool, inspired by ProSight Lite, to enable rapid interpretation of top-down mass spectrometry data at the single-spectrum level. By integrating advanced visualization with fast targeted searches, the tool will allow researchers to quickly assess truncations, modifications, and mass discrepancies for a given protein of interest. Moreover, it will include feature-level visualization of proteoform ions over m/z-retention time dimension that will allow for quick and accurate validation of proteoform quantification results.
By lowering the barrier between raw spectra and biological interpretation, this project will directly support exploratory proteomics, method development, and hypothesis testing in challenging top-down datasets.

Project Goals
The student will design and implement an interactive analysis module that enables:
Sequence-centric visualization of proteoforms, inspired by ProSight Lite, supporting user-defined mass inputs.


Mirror plots comparing user-supplied masses or m/z values against expected theoretical masses, enabling rapid validation and interpretation.


On-demand targeted searches, where a single spectrum triggers FLASHTnT via Python bindings to identify truncations and modifications for a specified target protein.


One-spectrum, one-protein analysis workflows, optimized for fast hypothesis testing rather than large-scale database searches.
Intuitive feature (m/z and mass) visualization for quantitative analysis validation, to support exact and quick comparison between theoretical feature traces of quantified proteoforms and the observed ones .
