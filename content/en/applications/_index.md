OpenMS is a flexible codebase that can be tailored to many different applications ranging from the standard label free analysis to top down, metabolomics, crosslinking or DIA.

OpenMS is used in a variety of applications: popular third-party apps which run OpenMS under the hood include

 - QuantMS [https://quantms.org](https://quantms.org)
 - QCCloud2 [https://qcloud2.crg.eu](https://qcloud2.crg.eu)
 - Proteome Discoverer Community Nodes
 

Applications which are integrated into OpenMS releases or are available as pipelines (e.g. using KNIME or Nextflow) are listed below. The pages will provide explanations on how OpenMS can be used to solve your problems and link to workflows that allow you to apply the tools to your data.

If you cannot find your application in the menu on the left, more OpenMS tools can be found in the [TOPP documentation](https://openms.de/doxygen/nightly/html/TOPP_documentation.html).
